# K-means-clustering
K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
Typically, unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labelled, outcomes.

A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.
Youâ€™ll define a target number k, which refers to the number of centroids you need in the dataset. A centroid is the imaginary or real location representing the center of the cluster.
